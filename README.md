# PopularMovieApp

This is a project being created for the Android Nanodegree program. The specs for this project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZlN1fUsCSKuInLECcJkslIqvpKlP7jWL2TP9m6UiA6I/pub?embedded=true).

This app uses the [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) API to populate movies into a view. Those movies can be sorted by popularity or rating.

## Quick Start
Get your own API key at [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org), and change NetworkUtils.java to use your API key.

Then you should be able to build this project in Android Studio.

## Features
In this project, I learned to use Retrofit and GSON to fetch data from the API and to populate an ArrayList with the movie data. I also learned how to use Room to set up the Favorite view.
