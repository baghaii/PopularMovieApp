# PopularMovieApp

This is a project being created for the Android Nanodegree program. The specs for this project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZlN1fUsCSKuInLECcJkslIqvpKlP7jWL2TP9m6UiA6I/pub?embedded=true).

This app will use the [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) API to populate movies into a view. Those movies will then be sorted.
